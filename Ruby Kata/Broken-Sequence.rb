# You have a sequence of positive numbers starting with 1, but one number is missing!

# Find out the missing number; if the sequence is not broken, you should return 0. Each sequence always increments by 1.

# In short: an invalid sequence (a string with non numeric character) must return 1, an already complete (or empty) sequence must return 0; a broken sequence with more than one number missing should return the lowest missing number; otherwise return the missing number.

# Note that the input may be with random order.

# E.g.

# find_missing_number("1 3 2 5") # returns 4, because 4 is missing
# find_missing_number("1 2 3 4") # returns 0, because the sequence isn't broken
# find_missing_number("1 5") # returns 2, because the sequence is missing more than one number and 2 is the lowest between 2, 3 and 4
# find_missing_number("2 1 4 3 a") # returns 1, because it's an invalid sequence. in this case, it's invalid because contain a non numerical character
